## Summary
*Include a brief summary that describes your system that your are modelling*
I am modeling a school system. It contains students, teachers and janitors. The main purpose of it is to be able to 
get all the information of each staff or student if called upon. This could be used for criminal investigation
since the system will give nessecary information that could be used to solve a case in a school.
